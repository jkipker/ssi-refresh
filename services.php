					<h1>Services</h1>
					<div class="section-description">
						<p>SSI’s diverse project background and experienced staff can assist clients with engineering and design, purchasing, administration, estimating, project management, cost control, scheduling, and construction management, through several service delivery methods to satisfy our clients many needs.</p>
						<p>As a growing company SSI does not have an extensive resume of large client projects however, more than 50% of our current staff and the principle owners have completed significant projects while working for Fortune 100 companies and/or for other major engineering contractors. Additionally many projects involve many of the same skill sets and abilities as our current chemical and refining client base require.</p>
						<p>We view our age as a company not as a weakness but as a strength. Since we are not tied to past practices so prevalent in older engineering firms, we are constantly finding new and innovative methods to provide our clients “Best Practice” engineering from across our industry.</p>
						<p>Using these “Best Practices&quot; for your company&#39;s individual engineering requirements, we are very confident that our capable staff will have no difficulty in providing innovative project engineering and design services, completing projects on time and under budget.</p>
						<p>We also believe the traditional method of design-bid- build places extraordinary responsibility on an owner who may already be at full capacity running a facility. Negotiating, purchasing and coordinating many separate project related services require a full time commitment of already scarce client resources, especially on larger projects. Southern Synergy can fill these gaps with the flexibility to deliver projects within our client’s parameters.</p>

					<p>SSI has a proven track record of assisting with risk mitigation and is committed to providing our clients solutions to meet their risk assessment and risk management objectives. Our engineers all have backgrounds as plant engineers in operating facilities and can assist clients with hazard analyses, implementation of management systems, audits, and creation of policy level or operational level procedures. Actual operating plant experience coupled with continuous training on Process Safety Management regulations, codes, and standards gives us exceptional insight into every aspect of a Process Safety Management covered facility.</p>
					<p>This insight ensures that SSI facilitators, scribes, and auditors can efficiently and effectively provide Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) services to ensure your facility is in full compliance with the OSHA PSM, 29 CFR 1910.119, and EPA RMP, 40 CFR 68, regulations.</p>
					<p>Safety Instrument Level consulting services are performed in compliance with IEC 61508/61511, API 14C, ANSI/ISA 84.00.01-2004, and OLF 70 standards.</p>
					<p>We have successfully performed PHAs for projects ranging in value from $6 billion to less than $10,000 for the refining and chemical industry throughout the U.S. We also assist clients with compliance audits, including OSHA National Emphasis Program assessments, Safety Integrity Level (SIL) Selection Analyses, and Layers of Protection Analyses (LOPA).</p>
					<p>These services are performed using Dyadem’s PHAPro and SIS-Tech’s SIL-SOLVER software, however SSI can utilize the client&#39;s in-house programs if requested.</p>
